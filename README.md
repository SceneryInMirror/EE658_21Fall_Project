# EE658_21Fall_Project
In this project, we are going to implement logic simulator, fault simulator and ATPG in three phases.

# Logic Simulation with Multiple Inputs
The logic simulation for {0, 1} is done. 
**TODO: We still need to take X into consideration.**

# Reduced Fault List (RFL)
This part is done.

# Deductive Fault List (DFS)
**TODO: Only one output for c499 doesn't match with the golden result. We have 85@0 fault which is not in the golden one. Kaixin will examine the code.**

# Parallel Fault Simulator (PFS)
**TODO: Need to be implemented.**

# Random Test Generation (RTG) and Fault Coverage (FC) Calculation
**TODO: Need to be implemented.**

# Kaixin's Token
