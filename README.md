# EE658_21Fall_Project
In this project, we are going to implement logic simulator, fault simulator and ATPG in three phases.

# Logic Simulation with Multiple Inputs

# Reduced Fault List (RFL)

# Deductive Fault List (DFS)

# Parallel Fault Simulator (PFS)

# Random Test Generation (RTG) and Fault Coverage (FC) Calculation
